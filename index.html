          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a US-based psychologist specializing in anxiety, burnout, and relationship
            stress in adults who juggle demanding careers, remote work, or big
            life transitions. My work combines Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
            with mindfulness and a trauma-informed lens, so you can feel both
            understood and safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our sessions, we move at your pace. We explore what you’re going
            through, make sense of patterns that keep repeating, and turn insight
            into small, realistic shifts that can actually fit into your everyday life.

              If your days are full of meetings, messages, and deadlines, but very
              little space for you, we’ll work on boundaries, people-pleasing,

              Most sessions are 50 minutes and take place once a week, on the
              same day and time. In some cases we may adjust the frequency based
              on your needs and what’s clinically appropriate.

            <p>
              Sessions are held via secure video, similar to a video call. You’ll
              need a stable internet connection, a private space where you feel
              comfortable speaking openly, and headphones if that helps you feel
              more focused or discreet.

              specific fee and insurance information is not provided. In a real

            <summary>How long does therapy usually last?</summary>
            <p>
              It depends on what you’re working on and how deep you’d like to go.
              Some people come for a focused 8–12 session block around a specific
